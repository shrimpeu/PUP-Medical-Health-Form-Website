## Challenges

We encountered a challenge with using CSS Flexbox for aligning the contents in the form. It was difficult to achieve the desired layout and spacing among the form elements. Despite following tutorials and examples, we struggled to understand how to properly use properties like `justify-content` and `align-items` to align items effectively.

## Usage

1. **Access the Website**: Navigate to the [PUP Medical Health Form Website](https://shrimpeu.github.io/PUP-Medical-Health-Form-Website/).
2. **Home Page**: The home page provides navigation options.
3. **How to Use**: Click the "How to Use" button for detailed instructions on how to navigate and use the website.
4. **Fill Out Form**: Click the "Fill Out Form" button in the navigation menu to proceed to the student information page.
5. **Submit Information**: The form is divided into three parts:
   - **PART I. STUDENT INFORMATION**: Enter your personal details such as name, student ID, and contact information.
   - **PART II. MEDICAL HISTORY**: Provide details about your medical history, including any past illnesses or treatments.
   - **PART III. PERSONAL HISTORY**: Fill in personal information relevant to your health, such as lifestyle habits.
   - At the end of the form, you will see the statement: "I hereby state to the best of my knowledge, my answers to the above questions are complete and correct."
6. **Submit Form**: After completing all parts of the form, click the submit button to send your information.
